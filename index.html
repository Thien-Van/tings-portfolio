                        <h2>Hi, I'm Ting</h2>
                        <p>I am a student of the Thinkful program, learning web development while working on my masters degree in Game Design. 
                            Based in Berlin, I am in the startup capital of Germany and naturally I have been working in some of them already. 
                            My passion is to create digital media and through my experience as a Game Designer I am always looking for ways to make user interaction fun and exciting.</p>

                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p>I am a big fan of games and online media. Every time I consume them, I am picking out features that I like and thinking about ways to improve the experience. 
                            The reason why I started the Thinkful program was to learn how to be able to actually implement these improvements and test my own ideas in real life. 
                            Outside of coding, gaming and designing I am a theme park enthusiast and a passionate cook.</p>
                        <p>
                            I am actually in the process of creating a Youtube channel to publish my recipes and have some fun cooking on camera.
                            In the future, after graduating from the Thinkful program I will be able to offer a full service package of creating and 
                            running a website or working on bigger projects as part of a team while my main focus would be front-end development.
