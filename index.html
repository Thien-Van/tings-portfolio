                        <p>Hi, my name is Thien-Van To and this is my online portfolio. 
                            I am a graduate of the Game Design program at the HTW-Berlin. 
                            I am specializing in Game Design and UX Design and currently on the lookout for a job.</p>

                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p>The reason why I chose game design as my major is that I enjoy developing new interactive experiences for a certain spectrum of different individuals. 
                            I love the process of working on a rough idea and shaping it to perfection through continuous iterations. 
                            Itâ€™s amazing to be part of a group of people, creating great experiences and discover new territories in the field of virtual interaction. 
                            Based on that I branched out into UX Design as someone who wants to make everything fun to use, even the most boring tasks such as making a payment.</p>
